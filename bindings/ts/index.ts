/**
 * Vibes binding for vitest / jest.

 * Declares a behaviour and runs it as an ordinary test:
 *
 *   behaviour({
 *     id: 'gcode.trailing-comment',
 *     covers: 'src/domain/gcode.ts#parseGcodeToMove',
 *     given: 'a G-code line with a trailing comment containing a coordinate token',
 *     then: 'the comment is ignored and the authored X survives',
 *   }, () => {
 *     expect(parseGcodeToMove('G1 X10 F5 ; X50 fast')).toMatchObject({ x: 10 });
 *   });
 *
 * See ../SCHEMA.md for the wire contract. Two rules from it are enforced here:
 * the line is written on ENTRY (a crashing test must still be recorded, or the
 * behaviour reads as deleted), and status is NOT written (it has not happened
 * yet — Vibes joins it from the runner's own output).
