//! Declare a behaviour from a Rust test and emit it to `behaviours.jsonl`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use vibes_behaviour::{behaviour, Behaviour};
//!
//! #[test]
//! fn gantry_stops_at_the_soft_limit() {
//!     behaviour!(Behaviour {
//!         id: "motion.soft-limit",
//!         covers: Some("models/src/gantry.rs#step"),
//!         given: "a move commanded past the configured soft limit",
//!         then: "the gantry stops at the limit and raises a fault",
//!         why: None,
//!     });
//!     // ... assertions
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See `../SCHEMA.md` for the wire contract. Two rules it imposes:
//!
//! 1. **Call it first in the test body.** The record is written on entry. If it
//!    were written at the end, a panicking test would emit nothing and Vibes
//!    would report the behaviour as REMOVED — "this PR deleted a behaviour"
//!    when a test merely panicked is the worst misreport available.
//! 2. **No status.** Pass/fail has not happened yet. Vibes joins it from the
//!    harness output on `test`.
//!
//! Inert unless `$VIBES_BEHAVIOURS` names a file, so the suite runs normally on
//! its own, and never panics: a ledger that cannot be written is a reporting
//! problem and the test's own verdict is unaffected.
